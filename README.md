# React Truffle Starter Box

This box is extends on the barebones react-box truffle by adding:
* A lower level view in the data structures truffle uses under the hood
* Detecting events emitted from a contract call.
* Simple get/set UI components for interacting with a contract.
* Debug logs and helpful messaging for when things don't go right.
